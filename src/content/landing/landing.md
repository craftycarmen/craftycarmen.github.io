I'm a **Software Engineer**. My passion for coding started when I created fan sites for music artists in my youth, using drag-and-drop platforms like Angelfire and Geocities, and later teaching myself HTML and CSS.

After going to school for PR and becoming a **project manager-turned-product manager** for 11 years, I realized it was time for a career change and enrolled in an **immersive software development course** with a focus on **full-stack web development**.

Now, I'm building full-stack, dynamic web applications, applying the professional skills I've developed over the years, and—more importantly—finally **pursuing that childhood passion** of mine.
